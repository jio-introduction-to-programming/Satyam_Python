# A brief on the Python's id function 

1. The id() function in Python returns the identity of an object. This identity is unique and constant for the object during its lifetime. 

2. This identity is often the memory address where the object is stored, though this isn't guaranteed by the Python language specification and can vary between implementations.

```
x = 5
print(id(x))  # Outputs: 4302642448 (this will be different each time)
```

In the example above, id(x) returns the unique identifier for the object x, which is an integer with the value 5. If we were to create another integer 5, it would have the same id:

```
y = 5
print(id(y))  # Outputs: 4302642448 (same as the id of x)

```

This is due to a process called "interning" which Python does for certain values to save memory.

## Objects are same if they've same ID 

Remember that even though two variables may contain the same value, they are not the same object unless they have the same id:

```
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [1, 2, 3]
print(id(x))  # Outputs: 140208304770304 (this will be different each time)
print(id(y))  # Outputs: 140208304770624 (this will be different each time)

```
In the example above, even though x and y contain the same value, they are different objects as shown by their different ids.

### More on ID function

The Python language specification does not define what exactly the value returned by `id()` represents. In CPython, which is the standard and most widely-used implementation of Python, `id()` does return the memory address of the object, but other implementations are free to return any unique number as long as it meets these requirements:

1. The `id()` of an object is unique and constant for the object during its lifetime. That means no two objects that exist at the same time should have the same `id()`.
2. If an object is garbage collected and a new object is created, the new object may have the same `id()` as the old object.

What the unique number actually represents is up to the implementation. For example, an implementation could use a counter that increments every time an object is created and use the current value of the counter as the `id()`. Alternatively, an implementation could use a random number generator to generate unique ids, as long as it can ensure that no two objects have the same `id()`.

In practice, most Python implementations, including CPython, Jython, IronPython, and PyPy, use the memory address as the `id()`, because it is easy to obtain and guaranteed to be unique for each object. But it is not a requirement of the Python language specification.
