    "In Python, a **module** is a simple Python file that contains collections of functions and global variables and has a .py extension file. It is an executable file and to organize all the modules we have the concept called **Package** in Python. A **package** is a simple directory having collections of modules. This directory contains Python modules and also having __init__.py file by which the interpreter interprets it as a Package. The package is simply a namespace. The package also contains sub-packages inside it ¹².\n",

    "For example, let's say you have a directory named \"my_package\" which contains two files: \"module1.py\" and \"module2.py\". You can import these modules in another Python script using the following syntax:\n",
